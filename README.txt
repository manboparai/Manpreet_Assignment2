To view a webpage locally, you can follow these steps:

1. Prepare Your Resume Files:
Gather all the files related to your resume, including the main document (e.g., a Word document or a PDF file) and any images or additional assets you've used.

--> If your resume is in a format other than HTML and CSS, you might need to convert it or create an HTML version manually. For instance:

==> Convert Word/PDF to HTML:
There are online tools or software that can convert documents to HTML. You can use these tools to get a basic HTML structure.

==> Manually Create HTML:
Create an HTML file manually and copy the content from your resume. Use HTML tags to structure the text, headings, and paragraphs. Embed images using the <img> tag.

2. Organize Files:

Ensure that all necessary files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.) are in the same directory or in their respective folders within the main directory.

3. Set Up a Local Server:
To properly render the webpage, you need to set up a local server. This can be done using various methods:
   --> Python SimpleHTTPServer:
      (i). Open a command prompt or terminal.
      (ii). Navigate to the directory where your webpage files are located using the cd command.
      (iii). Run the following command:
             "python -m SimpleHTTPServer"
             
             For Python 3, use:
             "python -m http.server"
 
   --> Node.js http-server:
       (i). If you have Node.js installed, you can use the http-server package. Install it globally using:
            "npm install -g http-server"
       (ii). Navigate to the directory containing your webpage files and run:
            "http-server"

4. Access the Webpage:
Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000 or another port number if specified in the server setup. Replace 8000 with the port number you used if different.

5. View and Debug:
You should now be able to view the webpage locally. If there are any issues, use the browser's developer tools (usually accessible by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect") to debug and see console errors.




Additional Notes and Considerations:

1. Browser Compatibility:
For the best experience, use a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.

2. Customization:
Customize the content in the HTML file to tailor the resume according to your preferences.
Update the styles in the CSS file to match your desired visual presentation.

3. Contact Information:
Ensure that your contact information is accurate and up-to-date.
Double-check email addresses, phone numbers, and other contact details.

4. Images:
If you have included images in your resume, make sure they are present in the repository.
Verify that image paths in the HTML file are correct.

Troubleshooting
1. CSS or Layout Issues:
Inspect the HTML and CSS code for errors.
Validate HTML and CSS syntax using online validators.

2. Images Not Displaying:
Confirm that image files are in the correct location.
Check the image paths in the HTML file.

3. Contact Information Not Updating:
Ensure that changes made to contact information are saved in the HTML file.
Clear the browser cache if needed.
